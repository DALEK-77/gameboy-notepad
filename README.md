A notepad for the Nintendo Gameboy. It's that simple.

You will need the GBDK (https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020/). Download the necessary binaries for your platform.

Here's a directory tree for the gbdk download:

```
gbdk
├── bin
├── examples
├── include
├── lib
├── ChangeLog
└── README
```

You'll need to download this repo from here: https://github.com/DALEK-77/gameboy-notepad/archive/main.zip

Unzip the archive into the "examples" folder.
Mac & Linux: Simply run "make" from a terminal in the folder you just unzipped.
Windows: open make.bat in the folder you just unzipped.
